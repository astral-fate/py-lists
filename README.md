# py-lists



we define a list in python as follows:

    a = []
list can include numbers, strings, or even Boolean     
    a = [true, 10, "listExame"]


methods related to lists:

       a = [1,2,3] 
       //insert is adding a new element to the list, based on the index; [index, value]
       a = a.insert[0,3]
       //adding a new element to the list, at the end 
       a = a.expand[3]
       //adding a new element to the end of the list 
       a = a.append[10]
       print(a);




More methods is sprint(), which eats the space between the values 
  


E.g

             Word1 = "thats\'s";
             Word2 = "Python";
             print("Word1"sprint()+"Word2");



Similar to Java script and ${}

           print("that'\s a string {0}, {1}" .format(Word1, Word2);
           
           
           
           
to icheck if list includes some elements, we can use "in"


       x = int(inpit());
       list = [1,2,3,4];
        if x in list:
           print("yes, {0} is in list {1}" .format(x, list));



For looping if certain element on the list is on, we use for in range. E.g.

             
              for x in range(4)
              ReadUser = int(input());
              Passenger +=1;
