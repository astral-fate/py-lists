# py-lists



we define a list in python as follows:

    a = []
list can include numbers, strings, or even Boolean     
    a = [true, 10, "listExame"]


methods related to lists:

       a = [1,2,3] 
       //insert is adding a new element to the list, based on the index; [index, value]
       a = a.insert[0,3]
       //adding a new element to the list, at the end 
       a = a.expand[3]
       //adding a new element to the end of the list 
       a = a.append[10]
       print(a);
